The Tripal Crop Docker sets up a Drupal site extended for biological data using Tripal. Drupal makes it easy to change the look and feel of your site using pre-packaged themes!

You can choose from any one of the free themes on [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_theme?f%5B0%5D=&f%5B1%5D=&f%5B2%5D=sm_core_compatibility%3A7&f%5B3%5D=sm_field_project_type%3Afull&f%5B4%5D=bs_project_release_has_full%3Atrue&f%5B5%5D=&text=&solrsort=iss_project_release_usage+desc&op=Search) or search for additional Drupal 7 compatible themes.

This [video by LinkedIn Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRlN5oyXGqM) walks you through installing themes and modules. Modules are used to customize functionality and themes are used to customize the look.
