Both Drupal and Tripal provide the framework for your site. Drupal is a content management system which provides edit an advanced administrative form for managing your site. For example, when you change the look and feel of your site or add basic pages, that is Drupal making your life easier! Tripal extends Drupal to provide support for biological data. For example, when importing and displaying biological data, that is Tripal at work.

## Drupal

 > Drupal is designed to be the perfect content management solution for non-technical users who need both simplicity and flexibility. It accomplishes this through a modular approach to site building. Unlike other CMS's, Drupal isn’t a prefabricated toy truck, but rather a collection of wheels, windshields, axles, frames, etc., that a toy maker can easily assemble. With Drupal, a maker could create a toy truck, but she or he could just as easily create a toy airplane, submarine, or robot. For this reason, Drupal may be described as both a content management system and a content management framework—one unified system that strives to have the strengths of both, without their deficiencies.
